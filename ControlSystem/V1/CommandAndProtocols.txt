Protocols:
    Shard-Server -> Used shards to scream at servers and for servers to listen on
    Server-Mainframe -> Used for the servers to talk to the Mainframe and vice versa
    Command-Mainframe -> Used to talk between the Mainframe and Command Centre and vice versa

Command Structure (These will be parsed as strings):
    0 - Info
        Command|Information|RouteTaken(Shard->Server->Mainframe)
        0|{Table}|3/1
        Used to push info to the Mainframe

    1 - Command
        Command|RawLua|Destination(Command->Mainframe->Server)
        1|print("Hello Mum!")|7
        Used to execute local code if needed. We don't need to specify Command or Mainframe Id as they are static
        This will also probably return the run result. Invalid code will cause a sever reboot to avoid issues.

    2 - Script
        Command|ScriptName|Destination(Command->Mainframe->Server)
        2|Lockdown|7
        Used to run a local script by name.
        This will also probably return the run result. Invalid script name will just be ignored.

    3 - Ping
        Command|PingMessage
        3|"Shard 3 is online!"
        This is simply used to make sure that we are able to send messages from devices.
        Good for error detection. Otherwise ignored.

    4 - GetStatus
        Command|Destination
        4|7
        I haven't quite decided on this yet. Ideally it will either ask if the Server is on - leading to a return, or ask for it to check all inputs now.

    5 - CommandResult
        Command|result
        5|"Command run sucessfully!"
        This is used to report something back that isn't redstone input. Examples include returning command 1,2 or 4.
